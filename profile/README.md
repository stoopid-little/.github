## Hi there 👋

A place for stoopid little repos - tiny projects that do one super-simple
thing to explore a technology. Like:

- A raylib application that draws each of the 3D (or 2D) objects and
  animates them according to the clock.
  - No dependencies besides raylib, but demonstrates how to do one simple
    thing.
- An MQTT project that reads from the queue and creates objects from the
  message's JSON.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
